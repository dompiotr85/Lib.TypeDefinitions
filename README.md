# Welcome to Lib.TypeDefinitions

## What's Lib.TypeDefinitions

The main assumption of this library is to simplify the naming of the basic
types found in Delphi/FPC environments and preserve them in optimised sizes
that will be identical for different platforms and Delphi/FPC versions.

## Clone with GIT

```
git clone https://github.com/dompiotr85/Lib.TypeDefinitions.git Lib.TypeDefinitions
